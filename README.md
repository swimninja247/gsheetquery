## Overview

For small projects, full Python frameworks can be overkill (Django), especially if you want code up and running quickly.  Google Sheets can be leveraged as a database and made accessible by GSheetQuery.

This library will allow users to interact with google sheets as a document database similar to MongoDB.

## Install

Install using `pip install gsheetquery` in your preferred command line.  Import to your python files like any other module.

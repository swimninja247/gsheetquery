## Overview

For small projects, full Python frameworks can be overkill (Django), especially if you want code up and running quickly.  Google Sheets can be leveraged as a production database and made accessible by GSheetQuery.

This library will allow users to create models via an ORM that will be stored in Google Sheets via the Google API.  This library comes with a query builder too.
